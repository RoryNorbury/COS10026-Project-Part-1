		<div class="section-container">
			<h3>Why we do what we do</h3>
			<p>
				In a world where human mortality has become so... inconvenient,
			 	Meow Meows offers the ultimate solution: consciousness digitization!
			  	Why be limited by your fragile flesh vessel when you can transcend into our
			   	state-of-the-art servers? We believe everyone deserves the opportunity to live forever*
			    	as data, free from disease, aging, and those pesky human needs like food and sleep.</p>
			<p><small>*Forever is defined as "until our servers are decommissioned or our company is acquired." Terms and conditions apply.</small></p>
		</div>

		<!-- Company culture description -->
		<div class="section-container">
			<h3>Company culture</h3>
			<p>At Meow Meows, we're all about balance! We offer our employees the perfect mix of terrifying corporate surveillance and
			 	cute cat-themed break rooms. Our managers have all undergone our proprietary "Nine Digital Lives" consciousness splitting procedure,
			  	allowing them to simultaneously monitor every employee workstation while technically still being a "small team."</p>
			<p>Our motto: "If you're not with us, you're data points waiting to be harvested."</p>
		</div>

		<!-- Job opportunities -->
		<div class="section-container">
			<h3>Opportunities</h3>
			<p>Join the consciousness revolution! At Meow Meows, we're always looking for bright minds (literally!)
			 	to add to our talent pool. Whether you're a neural network developer, a brain-to-binary specialist,
			  	or just someone with a remarkably transferable consciousness, we have a position for you!</p>
			<p>Current employees rate their job satisfaction as 9.8/10 (measured during mandatory happiness scans).</p>
		</div>



		<!-- Visionary goals -->
		<div class="section-container">
			<h3>Our vision for the future</h3>
			<p>By 2030, we aim to have digitized the consciousness of at least 25% of the global population.
			 	By 2040, physical human existence will be entirely optional. By 2050, our server cats will have gained sentience and merged
			  	with our digitized human clients to form a new hybrid species of cosmic consciousness called "Felis Humanus Digitalis."</p>
			<p>The future isn't just bright—it's backed up on multiple redundant servers!</p>
		</div>
