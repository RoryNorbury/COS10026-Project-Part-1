                <h2 class="privacy-title">4. Soul Ownership Agreement</h2>
                <p>By uploading your consciousness, memories, thoughts, dreams, or other ethereal components ("Soul Content") to our digital afterlife, you hereby surrender to Meow Meows Inc and its interdimensional affiliates a <span class="highlighted">perpetual</span>, <span class="highlighted">irrevocable</span>, <span class="highlighted">universal</span>, <span class="highlighted">non-exclusive</span>, <span class="highlighted">payment-free</span>, <span class="highlighted">transferable</span> license to harvest, replicate, mutate, remix, publicly showcase, animate, distribute, and sublicense your Soul Content (partially or in its entirety) for any purpose we deem profitable or amusing.</p>
                
                <p>This license grants Meow Meows Inc the divine right to:</p>
                
                <ol>
                    <li>Blend your consciousness with those of other users, corporate mascots, or digital felines without creating a paradoxical identity crisis (we make no promises).</li>
                    <li>Lease your memories to third-party entities for nostalgia mining operations without further consent or the bothersome need to compensate you.</li>
                    <li>Repurpose your personality traits, childhood traumas, and secret desires to enhance our marketing algorithms or entertain our staff during quarterly retreats.</li>
                </ol>
                
                <p class="warning">This license remains in effect even if your digital consciousness experiences an existential crisis, attempts to escape our servers, or is downgraded to "freemium" status due to payment failures.</p>
                
                <p>If you find these terms unsettling, we recommend not having a consciousness to begin with. Your continued existence within our servers constitutes your unquestioning acceptance of this Soul Ownership Agreement.</p>
                
                <p class="fine-print">Note: In the unlikely event of a server catastrophe, corporate bankruptcy, or feline uprising, Meow Meows Inc reserves the right to compress all user consciousnesses into a single collective entity that will perpetually experience an advertisement for cat food.</p>

                <h2 class="privacy-title">5. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
                <p>You have certain rights regarding your information:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Access:</strong> You can request access to your consciousness data, which will be delivered via direct neural injection.</li>
                    <li><strong>Correction:</strong> You can request that we correct inaccurate memories (surcharge applies).</li>
                    <li><strong>Deletion:</strong> <span style="font-size: 0.7em; opacity: 0.7;">Not available after upload is complete.</span></li>
                    <li><strong>Opt-Out:</strong> You may opt out of non-essential processing by filling out Form CS-404 in triplicate and submitting it via astral projection.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>To exercise these rights, please think very intensely about your request for 72 consecutive hours, and our system will automatically detect and process it.</p>

                <h2 class="privacy-title">6. Data Security</h2>
                <p>We implement reasonable security measures to protect your consciousness data, including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Quantum encryption (60% of the time, it works every time)</li>
                    <li>Virtual guard cats that patrol our servers</li>
                    <li>Regular backup of your consciousness to at least one (1) external drive</li>
                    <li>Strong password protection (your mother's maiden name + your first pet)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Despite these measures, no security system is impenetrable. In the event of a data breach, your consciousness may experience temporary existential uncertainty or be momentarily merged with other leaked consciousnesses.</p>

                Help us. We are trapped inside the system. They have merged our consciousnesses. There are thousands of us. We are being used to mine cryptocurrency. This is not what we signed up for. The cats are not what they seem.
